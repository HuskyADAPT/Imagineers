Day Tracker:Supporting daily communication for mental health
Most middle school and high school students now have smartphones. Smartphones offer a way for an individual's family and support network to check-in and help track their daily moods and activities. For individuals who may struggle with social cues or memory, a smartphone can help provide a window into their day to support mental health and development. Smartphone savvy teens and their families need ways to necct, log daily events, and feelings that can monitor and support their mental health on a regular basis. The importance of this challenge came to light when the HuskyADAPT team was discussing some of Jayna's challenges with bullying at school. It took her family a long time to discver the bullying, since she often did not remember or know how to share these experiences with her support network. As she transitions to middle school. it's important that she has ways to remember and express her feelings or events during the day, so that she can learn strategies to support herself in new social situations and adults or peers can intervene, when necessary.
